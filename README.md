# nCoV AI Health Hackathon, 2020

We created a web application to run a simple SIR model to predict the number of future COVID-19 infections over time using the COVID-19 Johns Hopkins data as of 2/8/20. Our aim was to allow people to visualize how their interventions to lower the R<sub>0</sub> could effectively flatten the curve in their own communities.

To run this application, click the binder link below and then select the `Appmode` button at the top of the resulting Jupyter notebook.
